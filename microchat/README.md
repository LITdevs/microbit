A silly chat service, with your favorites like artificial loading times, inspired by the Microsoft MakeCode challenge with the same name.

You can send messages to micro:bits nearby also running micro:chat.

## micro:chat guidelines

Try to be friendly, though! If multiple messages are sent in a row, all the messages enter "the queue", where each message is displayed one by one.

Because of this, don't spam your micro:chat friends by repeatedly pressing A or B!
